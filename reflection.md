What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

In terms of what worked, I was able to copy and paste some methods from procedural_resale_shop.py and put them in computer.py and oo_resale_shop.py. However, one of the main challenges I faced was determining if I had to modify these functions once they were in new files. In the case of the buy method in oo_resale_shop, I had to remove the portion that said global itemID because I could define itemID in init. In the end, not modifying the functions from procedural_resale_shop didn't work.

I also had to realize that for computer.py, I had to create new methods that didn't exist in the procedural code. Doing so allowed prices to be updated, infromation about the computer to be returned, and the operating system to be updated.
